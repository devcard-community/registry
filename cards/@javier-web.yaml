name: Javier Morales
title: Full-Stack Engineer & API Designer
bio: Building products end-to-end - from database schema to pixel-perfect UI. Believes the best full-stack code is the code where you can't tell where the backend ends and the frontend begins.

about: >
  Full-stack engineer who ships complete features, not half-finished layers.
  Built internal tools at two YC startups, now freelancing on developer
  platforms. Strong opinions on REST vs GraphQL (it depends), auth patterns,
  and why your ORM is probably fine. Runs a small Discord for indie SaaS builders.

archetype: The Full Stack Diplomat

dna: >
  Equal commits across frontend and backend repos. Never builds an API without
  a client to consume it. The Discord community hints at someone who teaches
  as much as they ship.

next_project: >
  A type-safe full-stack starter kit that generates API clients, database
  migrations, and UI forms from a single schema definition file.
