name: Leo Ferretti
title: Game Developer & Interactive Media Engineer
bio: Making things move on screen and feel right in your hands. From physics sims to procedural worlds.

about: >
  Game developer split between indie projects and tooling for other devs.
  Shipped two commercial titles on Steam, now building a procedural generation
  framework. Obsessed with game feel - the 50ms between input and response
  where games are won or lost. Streams dev sessions on Twitch and contributes
  to Godot's physics module.

archetype: The Pixel Mechanic

dna: >
  The repos alternate between complete games and reusable systems - physics,
  procedural generation, input handling. Every game ships with its engine
  improvements open-sourced. The Twitch streams explain the polish.

next_project: >
  A node-based procedural generation editor for creating game worlds with
  real-time preview, exportable to Unity, Godot, and Unreal.
