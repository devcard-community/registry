name: Yuki Tanaka
title: Functional Programming Advocate & Language Designer
bio: Types are theorems, programs are proofs. Building correct software through algebraic thinking.

about: >
  Functional programming enthusiast who writes production Haskell and Elixir.
  Maintains a popular effect system library and teaches FP workshops. Background
  in mathematics - moved from academia to industry to prove that FP scales beyond
  toy examples. Currently building distributed systems in Elixir at a fintech
  startup where correctness is non-negotiable.

archetype: The Lambda Whisperer

dna: >
  Libraries over applications - monads, parsers, type-level programming. The
  workshop repos show someone who believes FP adoption is a teaching problem,
  not a technical one. The Elixir pivot reveals pragmatism underneath the theory.

next_project: >
  A lightweight algebraic effects library for TypeScript that brings structured
  concurrency and composable error handling to mainstream JS developers.
