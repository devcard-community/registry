title: Mobile & Cross-Platform Developer
bio: Shipping native experiences on every screen - from watchOS complications to tablet-first productivity apps.
about: >
  Mobile developer who refuses to choose between platforms. Builds in SwiftUI and
  Kotlin Multiplatform, with a focus on offline-first architectures and adaptive
  layouts. Created a popular open-source sync engine used by 200+ apps. Cares deeply
  about perceived performance - if the spinner shows, the architecture is wrong.

archetype: The Bridge Builder

dna: >
  The starred repos trace the same arc: platform boundaries are problems to solve,
  not accept. The sync engine isn't just infrastructure - it's the thesis that data
  should flow across devices without the user thinking about it. The watchOS work
  is the logical endpoint.

next_project: >
  A cross-platform background sync framework that uses CRDTs for conflict resolution
  and adapts its sync frequency based on battery state, network quality, and user
  activity patterns.
