name: Rosa Lindqvist
title: Embedded Systems Engineer & IoT Architect
bio: Writing code that runs on things with blinking LEDs. From firmware to cloud, every byte counts.

about: >
  Embedded engineer who bridges hardware and software. Builds firmware for
  industrial IoT sensors, designs custom communication protocols, and maintains
  a Zig-based RTOS. Previously worked on satellite communication systems where
  you can't just push a hotfix. Believes that embedded development deserves
  modern tooling and testing practices.

archetype: The Signal Whisperer

dna: >
  Low-level repos with meticulous documentation - register maps, timing
  diagrams, power budgets. The RTOS project and Zig adoption show someone
  pushing embedded development toward modern software practices.

next_project: >
  An over-the-air firmware update framework for resource-constrained MCUs
  with delta updates, rollback support, and cryptographic verification.
