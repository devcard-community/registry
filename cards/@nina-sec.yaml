name: Nina Petrov
title: Security Engineer & Vulnerability Researcher
bio: Finding the bugs that matter before attackers do. Specializes in binary analysis, fuzzing, and making security tooling that developers actually use.

about: >
  Security engineer with a reverse engineering background. Started in CTFs,
  moved to bug bounties, now builds internal security tooling at a fintech
  company. Maintains an open-source fuzzing framework and contributes to
  cargo-audit. Believes security should be a guardrail, not a gate.

archetype: The Exploit Archaeologist

dna: >
  Every repo has a security angle - fuzzers, analyzers, audit tools. The
  progression from CTF writeups to production tooling shows someone turning
  attacker intuition into defender infrastructure.

next_project: >
  A supply chain security scanner that builds dependency graphs, detects
  typosquatting, and flags suspicious package behavior using static analysis.
