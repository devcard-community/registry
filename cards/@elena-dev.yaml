name: Elena Vasquez
title: Design Systems & Frontend Architecture
bio: Crafting component libraries that scale from startup prototypes to enterprise design systems.
about: >
  Frontend architect obsessed with the seam between design and engineering. Builds
  design systems that developers actually want to use - tokens, primitives, composable
  patterns. Maintains a popular Figma-to-code pipeline and contributes to Radix UI.
  Previously led the component platform at a Series C startup.

archetype: The Pixel Alchemist

dna: >
  The repos paint a clear picture: someone who sees the component as the fundamental
  unit of product development. Every library is built to be consumed, not just created.
  The Figma plugin work reveals the real ambition - closing the design-to-code gap entirely.

next_project: >
  A visual regression testing framework that compares Figma frames against rendered
  components at the token level - catching drift before it ships.
