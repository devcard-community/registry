name: Devon Park
title: Backend Engineer & API Architect
bio: Designing APIs that are a joy to consume. Every endpoint tells a story, every schema is a contract.

about: >
  Backend engineer focused on API design and developer experience. Built the
  public API platform at a devtools company serving 10K developers. Strong
  advocate for OpenAPI-first design and contract testing. Maintains a popular
  GraphQL-to-REST bridge library. Thinks about backward compatibility the way
  most people think about features.

archetype: The API Cartographer

dna: >
  Schema files outnumber source files in most repos. The obsession with
  backward compatibility and versioning reveals someone who learned from
  breaking changes the hard way. The bridge library is the thesis statement.

next_project: >
  An API changelog generator that diffs OpenAPI specs, classifies changes
  by severity, and auto-generates migration guides for consumers.
