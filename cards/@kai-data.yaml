name: Kai Nakamura
title: Data Engineer & Pipeline Architect
bio: Making data flow reliably at scale. If your pipeline breaks at 3am, you didn't build it right.

about: >
  Data engineer who thinks about failure modes first. Builds streaming pipelines,
  batch ETL systems, and the monitoring that ties them together. Previously at
  a Series D analytics company processing 2TB/day. Now at a healthcare startup
  where data quality is literally life or death. Contributor to Apache Beam.

archetype: The Data Plumber

dna: >
  Repos full of pipeline configs, schema registries, and data quality checks.
  The monitoring dashboards get as much love as the pipelines themselves. The
  healthcare pivot explains the obsession with correctness over speed.

next_project: >
  A declarative data pipeline framework that generates Airflow DAGs, dbt
  models, and Great Expectations suites from a single lineage graph.
