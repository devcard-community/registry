name: Marcus Chen
title: Systems Programmer & Performance Engineer
bio: Writing Rust where it counts - databases, compilers, and the hot paths everyone else avoids.
about: >
  Systems engineer who moved from C++ game engines to Rust infrastructure. Builds
  query engines, custom allocators, and compile-time verified state machines. Contributor
  to tokio and the Rust compiler. Believes that if your abstraction has runtime cost,
  you haven't tried hard enough.

archetype: The Bare Metal Poet

dna: >
  The commit history reads like a descent into ever-lower abstraction layers - web
  APIs to query planners to memory allocators. Each project shaves off another layer
  of indirection. The game engine background explains the performance instinct; the
  Rust migration explains where it landed.

next_project: >
  A compile-time SQL query validator that catches type mismatches and missing indexes
  at build time using Rust procedural macros and database schema introspection.
