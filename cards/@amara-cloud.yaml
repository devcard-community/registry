name: Amara Okonkwo
title: Cloud Architect & Serverless Specialist
bio: Designing cloud systems that scale to zero and to millions. No servers were harmed in the making of this infrastructure.

about: >
  Cloud architect who bets on serverless for everything that isn't a database.
  Built event-driven architectures processing 50M events/day on Lambda. AWS
  Community Builder and CDK contributor. Runs workshops on serverless patterns
  and writes a newsletter about cloud cost optimization. Strong advocate for
  infrastructure as actual code, not YAML.

archetype: The Cloud Weaver

dna: >
  CDK constructs, Lambda layers, Step Functions. Every repo ships with a cost
  calculator and a load test. The newsletter and workshops reveal a teacher
  who builds in public to force clarity in their own thinking.

next_project: >
  A serverless cost modeling tool that predicts monthly spend from CDK
  constructs before deployment, with what-if scenarios for traffic spikes.
