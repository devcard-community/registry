title: Platform Engineer & Infrastructure Architect
bio: Building the platforms that other engineers build on - from Kubernetes operators to internal developer portals.
about: >
  Platform engineer who thinks in systems, not services. Designs internal developer
  platforms that reduce cognitive load without hiding complexity. Built a Kubernetes
  operator framework used by 40+ teams. Believes that good infrastructure is invisible
  until you need to debug it, and then it should be transparent.

archetype: The Infrastructure Whisperer

dna: >
  Every repo is a layer in the same stack - GitOps controllers, Terraform modules,
  observability pipelines, developer portals. The pattern is clear: building the
  platform that makes platforms unnecessary. The operator framework isn't a project,
  it's a philosophy about who should own complexity.

next_project: >
  A self-service internal developer portal that generates Terraform, Kubernetes
  manifests, and CI pipelines from a single declarative app spec - reducing
  onboarding from days to minutes.
