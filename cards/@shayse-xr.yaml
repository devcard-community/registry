title: Spatial Computing, Computer Vision & AI Developer
bio: Building at the intersection of computer vision, neural 3D reconstruction, spatial computing, and AI-augmented workflows.
about: >
  Developer bridging computer vision research and spatial products. Builds depth
  estimation pipelines, neural 3D reconstruction tools, and mixed reality experiences.
  Ships native macOS apps for Gaussian splatting, Quest 3 MR starter kits, and
  AI-powered development workflows. Works across Swift, TypeScript, Python, and C#
  with equal fluency.

archetype: The Dimensionalist

dna: >
  Every starred repo tells the same story from a different angle: depth maps, Gaussian
  splats, diffusion models, SLAM — all ways of teaching machines to see. The AI agent
  work isn't a pivot, it's the control plane for the vision pipeline being assembled
  underneath.

superpower: >
  Sits at the rare intersection of computer vision research and product shipping —
  reads CVPR papers and stars depth estimation repos, then builds native macOS apps
  and Quest 3 experiences from what others leave as notebooks. Most CV engineers
  don't ship consumer tools; most app developers don't touch neural reconstruction.

trajectory: >
  Converging computer vision, generative 3D, and spatial computing into a unified
  pipeline. The arc from depth estimation stars to Gaussian splat apps to MR kits
  traces a clear path toward AI-driven spatial capture products.

next_project: >
  A live iOS depth-estimation-to-Gaussian-splat pipeline that feeds real-time neural
  3D captures into a Quest headset for collaborative spatial annotation — combining
  their CV research interests with their native app and XR framework experience.
